(Q1a)
(i) the first source of coupling is at the use of BillingSystem in the charge() method. This
is an efferent coupling as PhoneCall depends on BillingSystem's implementation.

(ii) The second source of coupling as at the use of LocalTime to calculate current time. This is
also an efferent coupling as PhoneCall references the LocalTime class and depends on it for
correctness (but not the other way around)

(iii) The main disadvantage of these efferent couplings is a lack of reusability or extensibility to
 the code. For example, it is not possible to easily switch to a different billing system due to
 specifically referring to the current one. Similarly, we may want to modify the way time is
 measured e.g. for mock testing but cannot do so easily. Additionally the same phone call code
 cannot be used in another system due to a lack of abstraction.
